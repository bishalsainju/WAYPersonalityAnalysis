# personalityPredictionPreprocessing Preprocessing part!!
To run:
python knn.py

"analysis" folder contains all the data analysis we have done!!

"a.txt" is just for the purpose of test

gfv.py --> getFeatureVector
ps.py --> processStatus
stem.py --> porterStemmer
sw.py --> stopWordsRemover
wcntr.py --> wordCounter
root.py --> forReference // not used actually
featureExtraction.py --> tfIdf implemented
knn.py --> KNN Implementation

with_all.csv file contains spell corrected user statuses
with_all1.csv file contains non-spell corrected user statuses

PS: Due to minor error, in the analysis folder I have taken 201
training sets and 49 test sets, in trainingFeature.csv and 
testFeature.csv files respectively, which does not have much influence
on the code as all as they were just created for the analysis purpose
